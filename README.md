ETL Team:

Datasets:
- Global Food Prices (https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/global-food-prices)
- Monthly Average Exchange Rates (https://www.ofx.com/en-us/forex-news/historical-exchange-rates/monthly-average-rates/)
- Yearly Birth Rate Data (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CBRT.IN)

Possible Investigations:
- Correlation between any of our three data sets
- See how food prices affect birth rates and vice versa

Our final database will be relational, with keys corresponding to country, food type, and possibly date.
