# ETL

The purpose of this ETL is to have a clean dataset for food production index, birth rate and the currency exchange rates that can be used for further analysis.

Datasets:
- Food Production Index (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.PRD.FOOD.XD)
- Monthly Average Exchange Rates (https://www.ofx.com/en-us/forex-news/historical-exchange-rates/monthly-average-rates/)
- Yearly Birth Rate Data (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CBRT.IN)

Possible Investigations:
- Correlation between any of our three data sets
- See how food prices affect birth rates and vice versa

Final database will be relational, with keys corresponding to country, food type, and possibly date.
